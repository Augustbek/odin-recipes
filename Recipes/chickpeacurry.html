        <h3>This is how the dish looks when it is done.</h3>
       This recipe tastes really good cause it has lots of good stuff like garam
       masala, chickpeas, tomato and paprika. If you are fast you can cook it in
       45 minutes but if you are more like me it will take you an hour to complete.
       However much time it takes you i can promise that it will be worth it.
